ModelX
------

https://docs.modelx.io/en/latest/

modelx is a Python package to build object-oriented models consisting of formulas and values to carry out complex calculations. You can think of it as a hierarchical and multidimensional extension of spreadsheet, but there's so much more to it!

modelx enables you to interactively develop, run and scrutinize complex models in smart ways:

* Only basic Python knowledge required
* Formulas defined by Python functions
* Object-oriented, supports composition and inheritance
* Parameterization
* Dependency tracing
* Reading from Excel and CSV files
* GUI as Spyder plugin (spyder-modelx)
* Saving to text files, enabling use of version control systems
* Document integration enabling use of document generators
* Pandas interface
